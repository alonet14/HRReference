    **NOTES**

    - The presented model is a simple VCO phase noise model based
    on the following consideration:
        If the output of an oscillator is given as
        V(t) = V0 * cos( w0*t + phi(t) ), then phi(t) is defined
        as the phase noise.  In cases of small noise sources (a valid
        assumption in any usable system), a narrowband modulatio
        approximation can be used to express the oscillator output as:

        V(t) = V0 * cos( w0*t + phi(t) )
            = V0 * [cos(w0*t)*cos(phi(t)) - signal(w0*t)*signal(phi(t)) ]
            ~ V0 * [cos(w0*t) - signal(w0*t)*phi(t)]

        This shows that phase noise will be mixed with the carrier
        to produce sidebands around the carrier.

    - In other words, exp(j*x) ~ (1+j*x) for small x

    - Phase noise = 0 dBc/Hz at freq. offset of 0 Hz

    - The lowest phase noise level is defined by the input SSB phase
    noise power at the maximal freq. offset from DC.
    (IT DOES NOT BECOME EQUAL TO ZERO )

    The generation process is as follows:

    First of all we interpolate (in log-scale) SSB phase noise power
    spectrum in M equally spaced points
    (on the interval [0 fs/2] including bounds ).

    After that we calculate required frequency shape of the phase
    noise by X(m) = sqrt(P(m)*dF(m)) and after that complement it
    by the symmetrical negative part of the spectrum.

    After that we generate AWGN of power 1 in the freq domain and
    multiply it sample-by-sample to the calculated shape

    Finally we perform  2*M-2 points IFFT to such generated noise
